			  Task 2 (Intermediate Level):

Concepts used: file management, functions, escape sequences, strings

Implement a program that mimics a student academic roll record system, allowing
students to register, log in, and view their grades. Admins should be able to
manage and enter grades. The system should also calculate and display the
Semester Performance Index (SPI) and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) for each
student.

- Create a function to register users as either students or admins using a
  unique user id and password and allow them to login based on successful
  credentials.  Ensure role-based access control: only admins can enter and
  manage grades, while students can only view their grades and performance
  indices

- Allow Admins to input and update student grades for courses each semester in
  their unique student id. Assume each course is of 4 credits and store the
  grades (AP (10), AA (10), AB (9)â€¦.) for each course by semester. The number of
  courses per semester is decided by the admin at the time of grading.

- Store the details of all registered users (students and admins) and their
  respective grades.

- Implement a function to calculate and return the SPI for a specified semester
  and CPI considering all the completed semesters.

- Implement a function to display the academic details (Student ID, grades by
  course, SPI, and CPI) for all semesters.

Note: No. of courses may vary each semester and for grading system refer IITI
